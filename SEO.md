Rani's California is an Indo-Western clothing brand founded by three sisters in honor of their grandmother, Rani, who worked at a textile mill in 1960s Gujarat.

Today, the sisters design from California, New York, and London, while production remains in the same Gujarat workshop where Rani once stitched. Each piece is small-batch (often made to order), using natural-dye cottons, handloom silks, and organic wools. The brand specializes in made-to-measure tailoring and works exclusively with second- and third-generation artisans paid above fair-trade wages.
