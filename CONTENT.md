## PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS (6 Products)

### Product 1: Indigo Block-Print Shawl
Hand-loomed cotton shawl with traditional Gujarati block-print motifs. Natural indigo dye fades beautifully over time, developing a unique patina. Lightweight enough for layering, substantial enough to anchor an outfit. Each piece varies slightly due to the handcraft process.

**Price:** $185
**Lead time:** Ships within 5 days
**Material:** 100% organic cotton, natural indigo dye

---

### Product 2: Reversible Linen Jacket
Tailored jacket with invisible seams—wear it indigo or olive. Cut with dropped shoulders and a relaxed fit that works over everything from tees to kurtas. Hand-stitched lapel and pockets. This piece takes 10 days to make because every seam is finished twice.

**Price:** $420
**Lead time:** Ships within 10 days
**Material:** European linen, coconut shell buttons

---

### Product 3: Wide-Leg Cotton Trousers
High-waisted trousers with a palazzo silhouette. Hand-loomed cotton from a family mill in Tamil Nadu. Deep pockets (actually usable), covered elastic waist, slightly cropped to show your shoes. Available in standard sizes or made-to-measure for your exact inseam and rise.

**Price:** $210
**Lead time:** Ships within 7 days
**Material:** Hand-loomed cotton, natural dye

---

### Product 4: Marigold Silk Wrap Shawl
Raw silk shawl dyed with marigold flowers—the same calendula Rani grew in her courtyard. Long enough to wrap twice or drape asymmetrically. Edges are hand-fringed. The color shifts depending on light: burnt orange in sun, deep amber indoors. Limited run of 12 pieces.

**Price:** $265
**Lead time:** Ships within 3 days
**Material:** Raw silk, botanical marigold dye

---

### Product 5: Quilted Wool Jacket
Structured jacket with traditional kantha quilting—tiny running stitches that take 40 hours per garment. Made from organic wool with cotton lining.

**Price:** $580
**Lead time:** Ships within 35 days
**Material:** Organic wool outer, cotton voile lining, kantha hand-quilting

---

### Product 6: Embroidered Linen Trousers
Straight-leg trousers with hand-embroidered cuffs—a nod to traditional pajama detailing. Made from stone-washed linen that's soft from the first wear. Adjustable drawstring waist, side seam pockets, wide enough to move but tailored enough to tuck in a shirt. The embroidery motif varies slightly; we can send photos of current stock.

**Price:** $295
**Lead time:** Ships within 12 days
**Material:** Stone-washed linen, cotton embroidery thread

## ABOUT / STORY (300 words)

### Rani's Legacy

In the 1960s, our grandmother Rani worked at a textile mill in Gujarat. After her shift, she'd gather fabric scraps—pieces too small or imperfect for production—and bring them home. At her hand-crank Singer, she turned discards into garments for her daughters: blouses from silk selvage, skirts from miscut yardage, jackets lined with sample swatches.

Rani never called herself a designer. She was practical. But her eye was sharp: she understood how to balance a narrow shoulder with a wide cuff, how to mix a traditional kurta silhouette with Western tailoring. She believed nothing beautiful should be wasted.

We are her three granddaughters. Today we design from California, New York, and London, but our garments are still sewn in the same small workshop in Gujarat where Rani once stitched. We work with the families of artisans who knew her, using natural-dye cottons, handloom silks, and organic wools. Each piece bridges her generation's thrift and our generation's questions: How do we dress with intention? How do we honor both heritage and the present?

Every Rani's garment is small-batch—often made to order, sometimes one of three. We don't chase trends. We make clothing meant to last, to be altered, to be passed down. Rani taught us that.

## WORKSHOP & ETHICS (100-125 words)

Our garments are sewn in a family-run workshop in Gujarat, India—the same town where Rani once worked. We partner with second- and third-generation textile artisans who specialize in hand-dyeing, block printing, and fine tailoring. Production batches are small, typically 3–10 pieces per style, which allows us to source deadstock and organic fabrics without waste.

All workers are paid above fair-trade wages and work standard hours. We visit the workshop twice a year and maintain transparent communication year-round. Fabrics are chosen for longevity: natural fibers, colorfast dyes, reinforced seams. Our lead times reflect the care required—most pieces take 3–5 weeks from order to completion.

We don't use synthetic fabrics, chemical dyes, or fast-production methods. If a garment doesn't meet our standards, it's altered or remade, never discarded. Rani's philosophy remains: make less, make better, waste nothing.

## FAQS (6 Items)

### 1. What are your delivery times?
In-stock items ship within 3–5 business days. Made-to-measure pieces take 4–6 weeks (includes tailoring and international shipping from our Gujarat workshop). We'll send progress updates and tracking once your order ships.

### 2. Can I return or exchange a made-to-measure garment?
Custom-made pieces are final sale due to their personalized nature. However, if there's a measurement error on our part, we'll remake the garment at no cost. In-stock items can be returned within 14 days in unworn condition for store credit.

### 3. How do I take accurate measurements?
After you submit a custom order request, we'll send a detailed measurement guide with photos and video. If possible, have someone help you measure. Wear fitted clothing (not bulky layers) and measure over your usual undergarments. We also offer virtual fitting consultations via video call.

### 4. What fabrics do you use?
We work exclusively with natural fibers: organic cotton, handloom silk, linen, and wool. Many fabrics are deadstock (surplus from larger mills) or naturally dyed using traditional methods. Each product listing specifies fabric content and origin.

### 5. How should I care for my garment?
Most pieces should be dry cleaned or hand washed in cold water with gentle detergent. Naturally dyed items may require special care (included with your order). Avoid direct sunlight for extended periods to preserve color. Detailed care instructions come with every garment.

### 6. Do you offer international shipping?
Yes. We ship worldwide from our California warehouse (in-stock items) and directly from India (made-to-measure). International delivery takes 7–14 business days. Customs duties and taxes are the buyer's responsibility and vary by country.
